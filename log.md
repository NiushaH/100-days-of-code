### Day 1: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Back on the Learn Track and got feet wet with a study group, and then completed OO Anagram Detector Lab

**Thoughts:** Found a Study Group Leader who explains well and teaches well.  Took too long to get right relationships in OO Anagram Detector Lab... learned with help and now it makes sense.  Would like to practice more.
